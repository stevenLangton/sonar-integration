                Our new approach
                to performance
            </small>
        </h1>

        <p>
            All around our business, we’re constantly looking for new and
            better ways to operate, so we can achieve even more as a team.
            <br /><br />
            You’ve told us that PDRs don’t always work well for
            you. So we’ve been looking at different approaches
            to performance reviews. Evidence from the latest
            research and what other leading businesses are
            doing shows that there are more positive and
            useful ways to discuss your performance than the
            way we do it at the moment.
            <br /><br />
            That’s why we’re launching Links. Links are
            regular, individual discussions with your manager
            – but instead of following a tick list and sticking
            to a formal rating structure, they’re all about
            identifying and acknowledging the difference you
            make every day.
