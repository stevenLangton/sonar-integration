        <h1>@Resources.AppName<small> Our new approach to performance</small></h1>

        <p>
            All around our business, we’re constantly looking for new and better ways to operate, so we can achieve even more as a team.
            <br /><br />
            You’ve told us that PDRs don’t always work well for you. So we’ve been looking at different approaches
            to performance reviews. Evidence from the latest research and what other leading businesses are
            doing shows that there are more positive and useful ways to discuss your performance than the
            way we do it at the moment.<br /><br />
            That’s why we’re launching @Resources.AppName. @Resources.AppName are regular, individual discussions with your manager
            – but instead of following a tick list and sticking to a formal rating structure, they’re all about
            identifying and acknowledging the difference you make every day.
